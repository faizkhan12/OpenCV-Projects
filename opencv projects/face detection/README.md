In this , I tried to implement Facial REcognition using DNN(Deep Neural Network).
When using OpenCV’s deep neural network module with Caffe models, we’ll need two sets of files:

1. The .prototxt file(s) which define the model architecture (i.e., the layers themselves)
2. The .caffemodel file which contains the weights for the actual layers

Both are already n the repository. 
There are documentations in the code itself.
