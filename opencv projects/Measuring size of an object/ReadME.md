In order to determine the size of an object in an image, we first need to perform a “calibration” (not to be confused with intrinsic/extrinsic calibration) using a reference object. Our reference object should have two important properties:

1. We should know the dimensions of this object (in terms of width or height) in a measurable unit (such as millimeters, inches, etc.).
2. We should be able to easily find this reference object in an image, either based on the placement of the object (such as the reference object always being placed in the top-left corner of an image) or via appearances (like being a distinctive color or shape, unique and different from all other objects in the image). In either case, our reference should should be uniquely identifiable in some manner.
